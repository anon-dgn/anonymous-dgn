# Anonymous Multi-Instance Learning Framework (Under Submission)

This repository contains the **official anonymous implementation** of a novel graph-based Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) framework, currently **under review** at a top-tier AI conference.

## üß† Overview

This project implements a novel Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) framework that enhances bag-level classification by modeling fine-grained instance combinations across bags.

Unlike conventional MIL methods that treat each bag as an isolated unit and rely only on intra-bag features, our approach constructs a **global instance correlation graph** that breaks bag boundaries and enables learning of inter-bag instance relationships.

To achieve this, we propose a graph-based MIL architecture that models the entire instance space as a **‚Äúdrawer graph‚Äù**, where:
- Bags occupy distinct regions in the graph,
- Instances are distributed across these regions,
- And classification is achieved via global instance-level message passing.

A contrastive loss is incorporated to enhance representation learning across both intra- and inter-bag instance relations. Experimental results demonstrate that this framework outperforms existing SOTA methods on several MIL benchmarks.
